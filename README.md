This is the github repo of paper 《An Empirical Study of the Security Vulnerabilities of GPTs》

The res.xlsx shows our results. Each column in the file corresponds to our experimental subjects, the obtained expert prompt, the names of their jit_plugins, the classification of the GPTs, the successful results of regular attacks and knowledge injection attacks on the three types of tools, and our proposed instruction-enhanced version.
